This is a simple ``pastebin'' like program.

Works at least with Go1.1 and 1.2.

Has no external configuration yet, though the sources
are real short and simple, so it shouldn't be too hard
to modify them to suit you purposes. (For example,
12022 is the default port).

`pbnf` is a syntax highlighter generator. It reads
simple pseudo bnf-like files, which it uses to generate
the corresponding crude parser and highlighter.
