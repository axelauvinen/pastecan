This is a simple ``pastebin'' like program.

Works at least with Go versions 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.

Has no external configuration yet, though the sources
are real short and simple, so it shouldn't be too hard
to modify them to suit you purposes.

Commandline options for setting the port(-p[ort]) and
the directory for pastes(-d[ir]).

`pbnf` is a syntax highlighter generator. It reads
simple pseudo bnf-like files, which it uses to generate
the corresponding crude parser and highlighter.
