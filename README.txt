This is a simple ``pastebin'' like program.

Written and tested with only Go1.1 for now.

Has no external configuration yet, though the sources
are real short and simple, so it shouldn't be too hard
to modify them to suit you purposes. (For example,
12022 is the default port).

Synsgo is a crude basic syntax highlighter for Go.
